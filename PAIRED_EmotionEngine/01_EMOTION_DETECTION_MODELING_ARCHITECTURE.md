# üß† Emotion Detection & Modeling Architecture - PAIRED EmotionEngine
*Multi-Modal Psychological State Recognition and Response Framework*

## üéØ Emotion Detection Framework Overview

üî¨ **Marie (Analyst) - Psychological Data Science Lead**

The Emotion Detection & Modeling Architecture employs **multi-modal psychological state recognition** combining behavioral analytics, physiological indicators, and contextual analysis to create comprehensive emotional intelligence without compromising privacy. Our approach integrates validated psychological frameworks with cutting-edge affective computing research.

üé® **Maya (UX) - Emotional Experience Designer**

From a user experience perspective, emotion detection must be **non-intrusive and empowering** rather than surveillance-based. Users should feel supported and understood by AI that adapts to their emotional needs while maintaining complete control over their emotional data and AI responses.

### Emotion Detection Principles
