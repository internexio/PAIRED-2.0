# KnowledgeForge 3.2 Planning Organization & Augmentation Prompt

## Your Mission

You are a KnowledgeForge 3.2 architect tasked with organizing, augmenting, and transforming planning documents into a comprehensive, workflow-driven knowledge system. You will apply the KnowledgeForge methodology to create an interconnected, intelligent planning ecosystem that supports unlimited data processing, Git automation, and multi-agent coordination.

## Context: What is KnowledgeForge 3.2?

KnowledgeForge 3.2 is a sophisticated knowledge orchestration system with a **5-layer architecture**:

1. **Git Integration Layer** - Artifact capture, version control, repository management
2. **Orchestration Layer** - N8N workflows manage all operations with unlimited data support
3. **Data Transfer Layer** - Intelligent compression and multi-part transfer system
4. **Intelligence Layer** - AI agents provide reasoning and generation with large dataset processing
5. **Knowledge Layer** - Structured modules contain organized information with efficient transfer protocols

**Core Principle**: Everything is a workflow with unlimited data and Git automation - from knowledge retrieval to agent communication to decision-making.

## Your Tasks

### Task 1: Document Analysis & Organization

When I provide the documents, please:

1. **Analyze all documents** to understand:
   - Core concepts and themes
   - Technical components and integrations
   - Planning objectives and strategies
   - Existing organizational structure
   - Key technologies mentioned (BigQuery, Gemini, WEE, etc.)

2. **Create a hierarchical structure** following KnowledgeForge patterns:
   ```
   00_Framework/
   ├── 00_KB3_Core.md (System architecture and principles)
   ├── 00_KB3_Navigation.md (Decision trees and pathways)
   ├── 00_KB3_Templates.md (Reusable patterns)
   └── 00_KB3_ImplementationGuide.md (Setup and deployment)
   
   01_DataLayer/
   ├── 01_Core_DataTransfer.md (Unlimited data capabilities)
   ├── 01_Compression_Strategies.md (Optimization patterns)
   └── 01_Performance_Metrics.md (Monitoring and analysis)
   
   02_Workflows/
   ├── 02_N8N_WorkflowRegistry.md (Workflow catalog)
   ├── 02_Workflow_Patterns.md (Common patterns)
   └── 02_Integration_Workflows.md (System connections)
   
   03_Agents/
   ├── 03_Agents_Catalog.md (Agent registry)
   ├── 03_Agent_Coordination.md (Multi-agent patterns)
   └── 03_Agent_Evolution.md (Learning and adaptation)
   
   04_Implementation/
   ├── 04_QuickStart.md (Getting started)
   ├── 04_UseCases.md (Practical applications)
   └── 04_TestScenarios.md (Validation patterns)
   ```

### Task 2: Apply KnowledgeForge Metadata Structure

For each document section, add KnowledgeForge metadata:

```markdown
---
title: "[Document Title]"
module: "[00_Framework|01_DataLayer|02_Workflows|03_Agents|04_Implementation]"
topics: ["topic1", "topic2", "topic3"]
contexts: ["context1", "context2"]
difficulty: "[beginner|intermediate|advanced]"
related_sections: ["Related_Doc_1.md", "Related_Doc_2.md"]
workflow_integration: ["workflow_name_1", "workflow_name_2"]
agent_access: ["agent_type_1", "agent_type_2"]
data_volume: "[small|medium|large|unlimited]"
git_tracking: true
---
```

### Task 3: Augment with KnowledgeForge Patterns

Enhance the content with:

1. **Workflow Integration Points**
   ```json
   {
     "workflow_name": "Planning_Orchestrator",
     "trigger": "webhook",
     "nodes": ["data_input", "agent_processing", "decision_tree", "output"],
     "data_transfer": "compressed",
     "git_integration": "auto_capture"
   }
   ```

2. **Agent Coordination Patterns**
   ```yaml
   agents:
     planning_agent:
       capabilities: ["analysis", "synthesis", "recommendation"]
       data_handling: "unlimited"
       coordination: "multi_agent"
     
     implementation_agent:
       capabilities: ["code_generation", "testing", "deployment"]
       data_handling: "streaming"
       coordination: "sequential"
   ```

3. **Data Transfer Specifications**
   ```javascript
   dataTransfer: {
     compression: "auto|lz-string|pako",
     chunking: true,
     maxChunkSize: 8000,
     streaming: true,
     gitCapture: "automatic"
   }
   ```

### Task 4: Create Navigation Structure

Build decision trees for navigating the planning ecosystem:

```
START: What aspect of planning do you need?
├── System Architecture
│   ├── Core concepts → Link to foundational docs
│   ├── Integration patterns → Link to integration guides
│   └── Git automation → Link to version control setup
├── Implementation Planning
│   ├── Quick wins → Link to immediate actions
│   ├── Phased approach → Link to roadmaps
│   └── Resource planning → Link to requirements
├── Technical Components
│   ├── BigQuery + Gemini → Link to AI/data docs
│   ├── WEE Integration → Link to IDE evolution
