## Workflow
Materials flow through evolution stages:
1. **Raw Materials** → Research and source content
2. **Planning Evolution** → Strategic synthesis across versions
3. **Implementation** → Technical execution and agent systems
4. **Deliverables** → Final synthesis for external integration

## Development Focus
This working directory contains active development materials, while `/deliverables/` contains polished outputs ready for KnowledgeForge integration.
