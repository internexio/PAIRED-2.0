# Naming Brainstorm Prompt for Modular AI Agent Tool Ecosystem

## Context
I'm developing a modular ecosystem of AI agent tools that work together across different IDEs and development environments. The core system is called "WEE" (Windsurf Evolutionary Ecosystem), but I need better naming for the individual tool repositories that will integrate with different platforms.

## Current Challenge
- **WEE-Core**: The foundational agent runtime and coordination system (this name works)
- **WEE-Claude-Code**: Integration tool for Claude Code IDE (this feels redundant/awkward)
- **WEE-VS-Code**: Future VS Code integration tool
- **WEE-JetBrains**: Future JetBrains integration tool

## Design Philosophy
- **Individual tools that work together**: Each repository is a focused tool with specific responsibilities
- **Modular architecture**: Tools can be used independently or composed together
- **IDE-agnostic core**: WEE-Core provides shared functionality, platform tools handle IDE-specific integration
- **Cross-platform collaboration**: Tools can communicate and coordinate across different IDEs

## Technical Architecture
```
WEE-Core (agent runtime, token optimization, configuration)
    â†“
Platform-Specific Tools:
- Claude Code integration tool
- VS Code extension tool  
- JetBrains plugin tool
- Future IDE integrations
```

## Naming Requirements
- **Clear purpose**: Name should indicate what the tool does
- **Professional**: Suitable for open source repositories
- **Memorable**: Easy to remember and reference
- **Consistent**: Works well as part of a family of tools
- **Scalable**: Naming pattern should work for future IDE integrations

## Current Pain Points
- "WEE-Claude-Code" feels redundant since WEE implies Windsurf
- Need naming that works for tools that bridge between IDEs
- Want to avoid confusion about which tool does what
- Need names that work for both standalone and collaborative modes

## Use Cases to Consider
1. **Standalone**: Tool runs independently in Claude Code with full agent capabilities
2. **Bridge Mode**: Tool connects Claude Code to Windsurf for token optimization
3. **Multi-IDE**: Multiple tools working together across different environments

## Request
Please help me brainstorm creative, professional naming options for this modular AI agent tool ecosystem. Consider:
- Alternative naming patterns that avoid redundancy
- Names that capture the collaborative/bridge nature
- Options that scale well to multiple IDE integrations
- Creative approaches that maintain clarity and professionalism

Feel free to suggest completely different approaches to the naming structure if you have better ideas!
