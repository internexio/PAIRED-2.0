```javascript
// claude-code-paired-bridge.js
class ClaudeCodePAIREDBridge {
  constructor() {
    // PAIRED 1.0 agent system
    this.agentTeam = new PAIRED1AgentTeam();
    
    // MCP communication components
    this.mcpClient = new MCPClient();
    this.routingEngine = new IntelligentRoutingEngine();
    this.tokenOptimizer = new TokenOptimizer();
    
    // Session synchronization
    this.sessionSync = new CrossPlatformSessionSync();
    
    // Initialize bridge
    this.initializeBridge();
  }
  
  async routeAgentRequest(agentName, request, context) {
    // Determine optimal platform for this agent request
    const routingDecision = await this.routingEngine.determineRoute({
      agent: agentName,
      request: request,
      context: context,
      currentQuotaStatus: await this.getQuotaStatus()
    });
    
    switch (routingDecision.target) {
      case 'claude-code':
        return await this.executeOnClaudeCode(agentName, request, context);
      case 'windsurf':
        return await this.executeOnWindsurf(agentName, request, context);
      case 'hybrid':
        return await this.executeHybrid(agentName, request, context);
      default:
        return await this.executeFallback(agentName, request, context);
    }
  }
  
  async executeOnClaudeCode(agentName, request, context) {
    // Execute agent request using Claude Code's native capabilities
    const agent = this.agentTeam.getAgent(agentName);
    
    // Prepare context for Claude Code execution
    const claudeContext = this.prepareClaudeContext(context);
    
    // Execute through Claude Code
    const response = await agent.executeInClaudeCode(request, claudeContext);
    
    // Track token usage
    this.tokenOptimizer.recordUsage('claude-code', response.tokenUsage);
    
    // Synchronize results back to Windsurf if needed
    await this.sessionSync.updateWindsurfState(response);
    
    return response;
  }
  
  async executeOnWindsurf(agentName, request, context) {
    // Route to Windsurf for execution
    const mcpMessage = this.formatForWindsurf(agentName, request, context);
    
    // Send via MCP bridge
    const response = await this.mcpClient.sendToWindsurf(mcpMessage);
    
    // Track usage and update session
    this.tokenOptimizer.recordUsage('windsurf', response.tokenUsage);
    await this.sessionSync.updateClaudeCodeState(response);
    
    return response;
  }
