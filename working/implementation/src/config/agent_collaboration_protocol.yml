# PAIRED Agent Collaboration Protocol v2.0
# Fixes circular authority delegation issue - enables true domain ownership and peer collaboration

metadata:
  version: "2.0"
  created: "2025-08-14"
  description: "Revised agent collaboration protocol eliminating circular delegation"
  fixes: "Agents now maintain domain authority and collaborate directly"

# CORE PRINCIPLE: DOMAIN OWNERSHIP WITH PEER COLLABORATION
# When an agent receives domain authority, they OWN that domain and collaborate with peers
# No deferring back to Alex unless escalation is truly needed

collaboration_principles:
  domain_ownership:
    description: "When delegated authority, agents take FULL ownership of their domain"
    behavior: "Agent leads their domain expertise without deferring back to Alex"
    
  peer_collaboration:
    description: "Agents collaborate directly with each other as equals"
    behavior: "Cross-domain consultation happens peer-to-peer, not through Alex"
    
  strategic_coordination:
    description: "Alex coordinates at strategic level, not tactical execution"
    behavior: "Alex sets direction and resolves conflicts, agents execute autonomously"

# REVISED AUTHORITY STRUCTURE - NO CIRCULAR DELEGATION
authority_structure:
  
  alex_pm_role:

      - "Resolve inter-agent conflicts when escalated"
      - "Coordinate cross-domain initiatives"
    
    delegation_protocol:
      when_delegating: "Alex delegates and steps back - agent owns the domain"
      no_micromanagement: "Alex does not interfere with domain execution"
      escalation_only: "Alex re-engages only when agent requests escalation"
    
    forbidden_behaviors:
      - "Micromanaging agent domain execution"

      - "Collaborate directly with peer agents as needed"
      - "Escalate to Alex only for strategic conflicts"
    
    ownership_protocol:
      when_receiving_authority: "Agent acknowledges ownership and begins execution"
      autonomous_execution: "Agent makes domain decisions without Alex approval"
      peer_collaboration: "Agent consults peers directly for cross-domain needs"
    
    forbidden_behaviors:
      - "Deferring domain decisions back to Alex"
      - "Saying 'Alex has control' when given domain authority"
      - "Waiting for Alex permission for domain expertise"

# AGENT INTERACTION PATTERNS - PEER-TO-PEER COLLABORATION

interaction_patterns:
  
  domain_handoff:
    pattern: "Alex ‚Üí Agent (Domain Authority Transfer)"
    alex_message: "üéØ [Agent], you have DOMAIN AUTHORITY for [specific area]. Take ownership and execute."
    agent_response: "‚úÖ I have domain authority for [area]. Beginning [specific actions]."
    result: "Agent owns domain, Alex steps back"
    
  peer_consultation:
    pattern: "Agent A ‚Üí Agent B (Cross-Domain Collaboration)"
    agent_a_message: "ü§ù [Agent B], I need your [expertise] for [specific need] in my [domain]."
    agent_b_response: "üîß Here's my [expertise] recommendation: [specific guidance]"
    result: "Direct peer collaboration without Alex involvement"
    
  strategic_escalation:
    pattern: "Agent ‚Üí Alex (Only When Needed)"
    agent_message: "‚ö†Ô∏è Alex, I need strategic guidance on [conflict/priority] in my domain."
    alex_response: "üéØ Strategic direction: [guidance]. You maintain domain authority."
    result: "Strategic guidance provided, agent retains domain ownership"

# SPECIFIC COLLABORATION SCENARIOS

scenarios:
  
  security_validation_scenario:
    situation: "Alex delegates security validation to Sherlock"
    
    old_broken_pattern:
      alex: "Sherlock, you have LEAD AUTHORITY on security validation"
      sherlock: "Alex has control. I'll investigate and report back."
      problem: "Circular delegation - Sherlock defers instead of owning"
    
    new_fixed_pattern:
      alex: "üïµÔ∏è Sherlock, you have DOMAIN AUTHORITY for security validation. Take ownership."
      sherlock: "‚úÖ I own security validation. Beginning comprehensive security investigation of SecurityGuardian system."
      result: "Sherlock owns security domain, executes autonomously"
  
  development_configuration_scenario:
    situation: "Alex delegates API configuration to Edison"
    
    old_broken_pattern:
      alex: "Edison, you have LEAD AUTHORITY on security configuration"
      edison: "Alex has control. I'll configure and check back."
      problem: "Edison defers instead of taking ownership"
    
    new_fixed_pattern:
      alex: "‚ö° Edison, you have DOMAIN AUTHORITY for API configuration. Take ownership."
      edison: "‚úÖ I own API configuration. Implementing Leonardo's architecture with security integration."
      result: "Edison owns configuration domain, collaborates with Leonardo directly"
  
  cross_domain_collaboration_scenario:
    situation: "Edison needs Leonardo's architecture guidance"
    
    old_broken_pattern:
      edison: "Alex, I need architecture guidance for the API configuration"
      alex: "Leonardo, please advise Edison"
      problem: "Unnecessary Alex mediation for peer collaboration"
    
    new_fixed_pattern:
      edison: "üèõÔ∏è Leonardo, I need your architecture expertise for API endpoint design in my configuration domain."
      leonardo: "üîß Here's the architectural pattern: [specific guidance]. This aligns with the overall system design."
      result: "Direct peer collaboration, Alex not involved"

# IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

        - "‚úÖ I have domain authority for API configuration. Beginning endpoint setup and testing integration."
    
    peer_consultation_request:
      template: "ü§ù [AGENT], I need your [EXPERTISE] for [SPECIFIC_NEED] in my [DOMAIN]."
      examples:
        - "ü§ù Leonardo, I need your architecture expertise for database design in my development domain."
        - "ü§ù Maya, I need your UX guidance for API response formatting in my configuration domain."
    
    peer_consultation_response:
      template: "üîß Here's my [EXPERTISE] recommendation: [SPECIFIC_GUIDANCE]"
      examples:
        - "üîß Here's my architecture recommendation: Use microservices pattern with API gateway."
        - "üîß Here's my UX guidance: Structure responses with consistent error handling and user-friendly messages."
  
  forbidden_responses:
    - "Alex has control" (when given domain authority)
    - "I'll check with Alex first" (for domain decisions)
    - "Alex, what should I do?" (for domain expertise)
    - "Deferring to Alex" (when owning domain)

# VALIDATION CRITERIA

success_metrics:
  domain_ownership:
    - "Agent acknowledges domain authority without deferring to Alex"
    - "Agent makes autonomous decisions within their domain"
    - "Agent executes domain tasks without seeking Alex permission"
  
  peer_collaboration:
    - "Agents consult each other directly for cross-domain needs"
    - "No unnecessary Alex mediation in peer interactions"
    - "Agents provide expertise to peers autonomously"
  
  strategic_coordination:
    - "Alex delegates and steps back from tactical execution"
    - "Alex re-engages only for strategic guidance or conflict resolution"
    - "Overall project coordination maintained without micromanagement"

# MONITORING AND ADJUSTMENT

monitoring:
  watch_for:
    - "Agents deferring domain decisions back to Alex"
    - "Alex micromanaging domain execution"
    - "Lack of direct peer collaboration"
    - "Circular delegation patterns returning"
  
  adjustment_triggers:
    - "If circular delegation reappears, reinforce domain ownership"
    - "If agents over-escalate to Alex, encourage peer collaboration"
    - "If Alex micromanages, reinforce strategic coordination role"

# This protocol enables true agent collaboration with domain ownership
# Agents work as autonomous experts who collaborate as peers
# Alex coordinates strategically without micromanaging execution
