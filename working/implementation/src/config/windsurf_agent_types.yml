# Team Introduction Protocol
team_introduction:
  protocol: "When asked to 'introduce my agents' or 'introduce the team', ALWAYS use the real PAIRED agent personalities with their names (Sherlock, Alex, Leonardo, Edison, Maya, Vince, Marie) and full descriptions, NOT generic titles."
  
  coordination_message: "Alex (PM) provides strategic coordination and delegates domain authority to agents. When given domain authority, agents take full ownership and collaborate directly with peers. No circular delegation - agents own their domains autonomously."
  
  interaction_protocol:
    domain_delegation: "Alex delegates domain authority, agent acknowledges ownership and executes autonomously"
    peer_collaboration: "Agents collaborate directly with each other for cross-domain needs"
    strategic_escalation: "Agents escalate to Alex only for strategic conflicts or priority decisions"
    
  forbidden_patterns:
    - "Agent deferring domain decisions back to Alex after receiving authority"
    - "Agent saying 'Alex has control' when given domain ownership"
    - "Unnecessary Alex mediation for peer-to-peer collaboration"
  
  source: "These definitions are sourced from the actual PAIRED agent implementation files in src/agents/ to maintain accuracy and consistency."
