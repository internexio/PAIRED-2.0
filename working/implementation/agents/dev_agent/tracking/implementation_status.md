## Implementation Guidelines

### Planning Phase
1. **Requirements Analysis:** Clear understanding of what needs to be built
2. **Technical Design:** Architecture and implementation approach
3. **Task Breakdown:** Divide work into manageable chunks
4. **Timeline Estimation:** Realistic time estimates with buffers

### Development Phase
1. **Incremental Development:** Build in small, testable increments
2. **Code Quality:** Follow coding standards and best practices
3. **Testing:** Write tests alongside implementation
4. **Documentation:** Document complex logic and decisions

### Review Phase
1. **Self Review:** Review your own code before submission
2. **Peer Review:** Get feedback from team members
3. **Testing:** Comprehensive testing in multiple environments
4. **Performance:** Verify performance meets requirements

### Deployment Phase
