# üåü Community Engagement Strategy - PAIRED 2.4
*Building Developer-Owned Federation Through Authentic Community*

## üéØ Community Strategy Overview

üé® **Maya (UX) - Community Experience Leadership**

The Community Engagement Strategy for PAIRED 2.4 focuses on **authentic developer community ownership** rather than traditional vendor-controlled user bases. We create genuine value for developers through peer learning, knowledge sharing, and collaborative innovation, building a self-sustaining ecosystem where community members become stakeholders in platform success.
