# ‚öñÔ∏è Regulatory Compliance Framework - PAIRED 2.4
*Global Compliance Strategy for Federation-Based AI Development*

## üéØ Compliance Framework Overview

üïµÔ∏è **Sherlock (QA) - Compliance Leadership**

The Regulatory Compliance Framework for PAIRED 2.4 ensures **proactive compliance with global data protection, AI governance, and software development regulations** while maintaining the federation-first architecture advantages. Our privacy-by-design approach provides inherent compliance benefits that become competitive advantages in regulated markets.

üëë **Alex (PM) - Strategic Compliance Coordination**

From a strategic perspective, compliance must be **built into our competitive advantage** rather than treated as a constraint. Our federation architecture and privacy-first design enable compliance capabilities that centralized competitors cannot match, creating market access advantages in regulated industries and regions.

### Compliance Framework Principles

    - "Industry standard compliance (SOC 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP)"
    - "Professional certification and audit readiness"
    - "Compliance as competitive differentiation in enterprise markets"
  
  continuous_compliance_monitoring:
