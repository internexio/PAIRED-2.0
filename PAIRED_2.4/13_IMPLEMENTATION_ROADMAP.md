# üöÄ Implementation Roadmap - PAIRED 2.4
*Phased Federation Delivery with Measurable Milestones*

## üéØ Implementation Strategy Overview

üèà **Vince (Scrum Master) - Delivery Leadership**

The Implementation Roadmap for PAIRED 2.4 follows **agile delivery principles** with quarterly milestones that build federation capabilities incrementally while maintaining continuous value delivery. Each phase establishes foundational capabilities that enable the next phase, creating a sustainable development velocity that scales with team growth.

üëë **Alex (PM) - Strategic Implementation Coordination**

From a strategic perspective, the roadmap must **balance ambitious federation goals with practical delivery constraints**. We prioritize features that demonstrate immediate developer value while building the network effects foundation that creates long-term competitive advantages. Each milestone includes measurable success criteria and go/no-go decision points.
