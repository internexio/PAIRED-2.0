# üåâ MCP Bridge Architecture - PAIRED ClaudeCode
*Model Context Protocol Implementation for Multi-Platform AI Coordination*

## üéØ MCP Bridge Overview

üèõÔ∏è **Leonardo (Architecture) - Bridge Systems Designer**

The MCP Bridge Architecture implements the **Model Context Protocol standard** to enable seamless communication between Claude Code and Windsurf environments while maintaining agent state consistency and optimal token utilization. This creates the foundational infrastructure for multi-platform AI coordination.

‚ö° **Edison (Dev) - Bridge Implementation Lead**

From an implementation perspective, the MCP Bridge must provide **real-time bidirectional communication** with sub-100ms latency while handling connection failures gracefully and maintaining data integrity across platform switches. The architecture prioritizes reliability and performance.

üëë **Alex (PM) - Strategic Bridge Leadership**

The MCP Bridge represents a **critical strategic advantage** in multi-platform AI coordination. By implementing industry-standard protocols while adding intelligent routing capabilities, we create a defensible technical moat that enables seamless developer experience across platforms while optimizing resource utilization and costs.
