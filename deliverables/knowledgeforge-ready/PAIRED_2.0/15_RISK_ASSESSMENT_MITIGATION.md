# ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment & Mitigation - PAIRED 2.4
*Comprehensive Risk Management for Federation Success*

## üéØ Risk Management Framework

üïµÔ∏è **Sherlock (QA) - Risk Assessment Leadership**

The Risk Assessment & Mitigation framework for PAIRED 2.4 employs **systematic risk identification and proactive mitigation strategies** across technical, market, operational, and strategic dimensions. Each risk is quantified with probability and impact assessments, enabling data-driven prioritization and resource allocation for maximum protection of federation success.

üëë **Alex (PM) - Strategic Risk Coordination**

From a strategic perspective, risk management must **balance innovation velocity with prudent protection** of our federation-first competitive advantages. We prioritize risks that could fundamentally undermine our network effects or developer trust, while maintaining agility to respond to emerging threats and opportunities.

### Risk Management Principles
