# üîê Security & Privacy Architecture - PAIRED 2.4
*Zero-Trust Federation with Privacy-by-Design*

## üéØ Security Architecture Overview

üèõÔ∏è **Leonardo (Architecture) - Lead Security Designer**

The Security & Privacy Architecture for PAIRED 2.4 implements a **zero-trust federation model** where every peer, communication, and data exchange is cryptographically verified and privacy-protected by default. This architecture ensures that federation scaling enhances rather than compromises security through distributed validation and redundant protection mechanisms.

üïµÔ∏è **Sherlock (QA) - Security Validation Lead**

From a quality assurance perspective, security must be **continuously validated and tested** at every layer. We need comprehensive security testing frameworks, penetration testing protocols, and real-time threat detection to ensure the federation remains secure as it scales. Every security claim must be rigorously validated through automated and manual testing.

### Core Security Principles
```yaml
zero_trust_security_model:
  never_trust_always_verify:
    - "Every peer must be cryptographically authenticated before communication"
    - "All data exchanges require end-to-end encryption and integrity verification"
    - "Continuous verification of peer identity and behavior throughout sessions"
    - "Automatic revocation of access for suspicious or compromised peers"
  
  defense_in_depth:
    - "Multiple layers of security protection at network, application, and data levels"
    - "Redundant security mechanisms to prevent single points of failure"
    - "Fail-secure design where security failures default to maximum protection"
    - "Compartmentalized security to limit blast radius of potential breaches"
  
  privacy_by_design:
    - "Data minimization: collect only necessary data for functionality"
    - "Purpose limitation: use data only for explicitly stated purposes"
    - "Storage limitation: retain data only as long as necessary"
    - "User control: granular user control over all personal data"
  
  cryptographic_foundation:
    - "End-to-end encryption for all peer-to-peer communications"
    - "Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving data sharing"
    - "Perfect forward secrecy to protect past communications"
    - "Post-quantum cryptography preparation for future-proofing"
```
