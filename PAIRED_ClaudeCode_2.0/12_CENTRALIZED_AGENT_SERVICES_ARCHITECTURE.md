 can # üèóÔ∏è Centralized Agent Services Architecture - PAIRED ClaudeCode
*Multi-IDE/LLM Integration with Centralized Agent Services and Paygate*

## üéØ Centralized Services Overview

üëë **Alex (PM) - Strategic Services Leadership**

Centralized Agent Services Architecture transforms PAIRED from a dual-platform solution into a **universal multi-IDE ecosystem** where our 7-agent team operates as centralized services accessible through standardized APIs, enabling integration with VS Code, Windsurf, Replit, and any future development environments.

üèõÔ∏è **Leonardo (Architecture) - Services Architecture Designer**

From an architectural perspective, centralization requires **microservices architecture** with agent services, API gateways, authentication layers, and standardized protocols that enable seamless integration across diverse IDE environments while maintaining performance and reliability.

üî¨ **Marie (Analyst) - Services Intelligence Lead**

Centralized services create **scalable business model opportunities** through usage-based pricing, premium agent capabilities, and enterprise service tiers that monetize our agent intelligence across the entire development tool ecosystem.
