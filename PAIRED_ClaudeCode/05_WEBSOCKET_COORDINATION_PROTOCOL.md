# ‚ö° WebSocket Coordination Protocol - PAIRED ClaudeCode
*Real-Time Communication Infrastructure for Multi-Platform Agent Coordination*

## üéØ WebSocket Protocol Overview

‚ö° **Edison (Dev) - Real-Time Communication Lead**

The WebSocket Coordination Protocol provides **sub-100ms real-time communication** between Claude Code and Windsurf environments, enabling instant agent state synchronization, collaborative session management, and seamless platform coordination. This creates the high-performance backbone for multi-platform AI collaboration.

üèõÔ∏è **Leonardo (Architecture) - Protocol Architecture Designer**

From an architectural perspective, the WebSocket protocol must handle **millions of concurrent connections** with fault-tolerant operation, intelligent message routing, and comprehensive error recovery while maintaining message ordering and delivery guarantees across platform boundaries.

üëë **Alex (PM) - Strategic Communication Leadership**

Real-time coordination represents a **critical competitive advantage** enabling instantaneous collaboration impossible with traditional request-response architectures. This creates superior user experience and technical differentiation from competitors limited to slower communication methods.
