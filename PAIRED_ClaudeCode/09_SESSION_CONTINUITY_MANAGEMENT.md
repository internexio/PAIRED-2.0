# üîÑ Session Continuity Management - PAIRED ClaudeCode
*Seamless Workflow Preservation Across Platform Switches*

## üéØ Session Continuity Overview

üé® **Maya (UX) - Continuity Experience Designer**

Session Continuity Management ensures **uninterrupted workflow preservation** when developers switch between Claude Code and Windsurf, maintaining complete context, conversation history, and project state for seamless productivity across platform transitions.

üèõÔ∏è **Leonardo (Architecture) - Continuity Architecture Designer**

From an architectural perspective, session continuity requires **stateful coordination** with distributed session management, real-time synchronization, and comprehensive state preservation that maintains consistency across platform boundaries.

üëë **Alex (PM) - Strategic Continuity Leadership**

Session continuity represents a **critical user experience differentiator** that eliminates friction from multi-platform workflows, creating superior productivity and user satisfaction impossible with single-platform solutions.
