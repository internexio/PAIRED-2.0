# üöÄ Controlled Deployment Strategy - Phased Rollout and Risk Management
*Safe ClaudeCode Integration with Gradual User Adoption and Success Validation*

## üéØ Controlled Deployment Overview

üëë **Alex (PM) - Strategic Deployment Leadership**

Controlled Deployment Strategy ensures **safe ClaudeCode integration** through phased rollout, risk mitigation, and user success validation that minimizes disruption while maximizing adoption success and token savings realization.

üèà **Vince (Scrum Master) - Deployment Process Lead**

From a process perspective, controlled deployment requires **systematic rollout management** with clear phases, success criteria, risk monitoring, and stakeholder coordination that ensures smooth transition and user satisfaction.

üïµÔ∏è **Sherlock (QA) - Deployment Quality Assurance**

Quality assurance focuses on **comprehensive validation** at each deployment phase with testing protocols, performance verification, and issue resolution that maintains system reliability and user confidence.
